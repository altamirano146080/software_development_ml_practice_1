Software Development Oriented to Machine Learning Practice
==========================================================

This project focuses on the analysis of asteroid impact risk using machine
learning techniques.

The project includes:

* Dataset downloading and preparation.
* Data cleaning and transformation.
* Feature creation.
* Exploratory data analysis.
* Neural network training.
* Model evaluation.
* Impact probability predictions.
* Visualization and reporting.
